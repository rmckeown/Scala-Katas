This is meant to be a helpful exercise list of Kata's for people new to scala.

Currently there are 3 Katas: FizzBuzz, Prime Factorization and Bowling Scoring.

FizzBuzz or Primes should be attempted first then Bowling.

To run the tests go into each project folder, like fizzbuzz, and use sbt test.
You can move on to the next Kata when all the tests pass. Also do not be afraid to add more test conditions if you feel some are missing.  

To Install Scala on Mac run the following commands

brew update
brew install scala
brew install sbt
