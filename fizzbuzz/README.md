The goal of this project is to write scala code that will do the following:

1. "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
2. "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5
3. "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by 15
4. The original number if none of the previous are fulfilled.

Scalatest unit tests will be provided but actual FizzBuzz code will need to be completed.
